## Purpose
This repo was created for my projects on llms that I will ameliorate through the journey and will later create another repo for each project containing everything the project needs with demo.

## What I Have Learned So Far
- Creating a development environment for my workplace in anaconda and/or cursor
- How to call api keys
- How to mingle with program and good prompt for my llms to acct the way I want

## Repository Structure
/-projects
  /-project-web-summarizer
    web_summarizer.py
    web_summarizer.ipynb
    website_summarizer.ipynb
  /-ipynb-checkpoint
  

## How to Run
Make sure Python, cursor is installed, then run:
Then pull project folder in your cursor app, there you will be able to modify and program with cursor (IDE)
To run the python notebook file you press shift + enter on the markdown space where your code is. Take note you should run from the start of the folder, run from first to last markdown code.

## Next Steps
- Improve the project to be able to summarize email, pdf, videos and files
- Need help from you if any way of doing the program in an easy method.
