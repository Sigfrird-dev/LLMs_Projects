# Short Explanation
Here we are creating an LLMs that takes a website and provide you with everything concerning the website 
The steps below give how my program functions for those who will love to use it:
1- I created an API key from openai and created my anaconda environment for development.
2- In the repository you will find some fill, they contain the packages and libaries I used in the development but there are also some of which are not used in the project.
3. I imported some libary function like selenium, beautiful soup, ollama ( because I run the program locally in my computer) and others you will find in the program.
4. I later created a class containing the function for initialise, scraping the website. I place the function scrape in an exception for the case where if the user doesnot enter the correct website or website doesnot exists.
5. I added our system prompt and user prompt
6. We run the program with different websites and the results were astonishing.
